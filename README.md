# facets-knowledge-panels

Providing knowledge panels for a particular Open Food Facts facet (category, brand, etc...)

## Why facets-knowledge-panels?

- Provides applications with a set of informative or actionable items which are contextual to a specific facet.
- The primary goal is to allow high level contributions by users that maybe interested in a particular subset of the database, like a particular food category, a brand, a location etc.
- We reuse the knowledge panel format, which remove the need for the application to change as the server side code change, or to implement specific business logic.
